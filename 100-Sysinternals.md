Hello all! Today i would be doing a walkthru one of the Blue Team CTF challenge in cyberdefenders.org [100-Sysinternals](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/sysinternals/)! This challenge is about analysing a laggy windows system after downloading a possibly malicious Sysinternals suite!

### Question 1: What was the malicious executable file name that the user downloaded?
This is pretty straightforward, we can just proceed to navigate to User's Downloads, Desktop or even Documents directory ANDDD we found the answer under **C:\Public\Downloads**!!!
